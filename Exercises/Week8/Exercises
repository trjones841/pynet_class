See my above Django notes file for assistance on these exercises.  You will need to use the lab environment for these exercises.


1. Initialize your Django database. Add the seven NetworkDevice objects and two Credentials objects into your database.  After this initialization, you should be able to do the following (from the ~/DJANGOX/djproject directory):

$ python manage.py shell

>>> from net_system.models import NetworkDevice, Credentials
>>> net_devices = NetworkDevice.objects.all()
>>> net_devices
[<NetworkDevice: pynet-rtr1>, <NetworkDevice: pynet-sw1>, <NetworkDevice: pynet-sw2>, <NetworkDevice: pynet-sw3>, <NetworkDevice: pynet-sw4>, <NetworkDevice: juniper-srx>, <NetworkDevice: pynet-rtr2>]

>>> creds = Credentials.objects.all()
>>> creds
[<Credentials: pyclass>, <Credentials: admin1>]

    b. Update the NetworkDevice objects such that each NetworkDevice links to the correct Credentials.

2. Set the vendor field of each NetworkDevice to the appropriate vendor. Save this field to the database.

3. Create two new test NetworkDevices in the database. Use both direct object creation and the .get_or_create() method to create the devices.

4. Remove the two objects created in the previous exercise from the database.

5. Use Netmiko to connect to each of the devices in the database. Execute 'show version' on each device. Calculate the amount of time required to do this. 

6. Use threads and Netmiko to execute 'show version' on each device in the database. Calculate the amount of time required to do this. What is the difference in time between executing 'show version' sequentially versus using threads?

7. Repeat exercise #6 except use processes. 

8. Optional bonus question--use a queue to get the output data back from the child processes in question #7. Print this output data to the screen in the main process.
