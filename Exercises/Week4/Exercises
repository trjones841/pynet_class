The username and password for pynet-rtr1, pynet-rtr2, and for the juniper-srx are:

username: pyclass
password: 88newclass



1. Use Paramiko to retrieve the entire 'show version' output from pynet-rtr2. 


2. Use Paramiko to change the 'logging buffered <size>' configuration on pynet-rtr2. This will require that you enter into configuration mode.


3. Use Pexpect to retrieve the output of 'show ip int brief' from pynet-rtr2.


4. Use PExpect to change the logging buffer size (logging buffered <size>) on pynet-rtr2. Verify this change by examining the output of 'show run'.


5. Use Netmiko to enter into configuration mode on pynet-rtr2. Also use Netmiko to verify your state (i.e. that you are currently in configuration mode).


6. Use Netmiko to execute 'show arp' on pynet-rtr1, pynet-rtr2, and juniper-srx.


7. Use Netmiko to change the logging buffer size (logging buffered <size>) on pynet-rtr2.


8. Use Netmiko to change the logging buffer size (logging buffered <size>) and to disable console logging (no logging console) from a file on both pynet-rtr1 and pynet-rtr2 (see 'Errata and Other Info, item #4).


9. Bonus Question - Redo exercise6 but have the SSH connections happen concurrently using either threads or processes (see example). What main issue is there with using threads in Python?
