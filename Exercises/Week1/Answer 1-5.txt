	tjones@SRVR02:~/PycharmProjects/pynet_class$ git push
	warning: push.default is unset; its implicit value has changed in
	Git 2.0 from 'matching' to 'simple'. To squelch this message
	and maintain the traditional behavior, use:

	  git config --global push.default matching

	To squelch this message and adopt the new behavior now, use:

	  git config --global push.default simple

	When push.default is set to 'matching', git will push local branches
	to the remote branches that already exist with the same name.

	Since Git 2.0, Git defaults to the more conservative 'simple'
	behavior, which only pushes the current branch to the corresponding
	remote branch that 'git pull' uses to update the current branch.

	See 'git help config' and search for 'push.default' for further information.
	(the 'simple' mode was introduced in Git 1.7.11. Use the similar mode
	'current' instead of 'simple' if you sometimes use older versions of Git)
