1. Using Ansible, configure three VLANs on the Arista switch specifying both the VLAN IDs and the VLAN names.  For the VLAN IDs randomly pick three numbers between 100 and 999.


2. Use Ansible to configure your 'primary Ethernet interface' as follows:

interface description:     *** IN USE ***
switchport mode:          access
VLAN:                           <one of the VLANs created in exercise1>

Your 'primary Ethernet interface' is specified in your ~/ansible-hosts file.

If your primary interface is already 'IN USE' (by someone else), then use your secondary interface (once again specified in ~/ansible-hosts).  You can determine if an interface is already in use by SSH'ing into the switch. Reminder, do NOT use Ethernet1.



3. Use Ansible to configure your 'primary Ethernet interface' as follows:

switchport mode:           trunk
trunk native VLAN:        VLAN1
trunk allowed VLANs:    <the three VLANs created in exercise1>



4. Use Ansible to restore your 'primary Ethernet interface' back to the following state (or your secondary interface depending on which one you used):
description:                    <none>
switchport mode:           access
access VLAN:                1
trunk allowed VLANs:    all

Also use Ansible to remove the three VLANs that you configured.


5. Use the cisco_file_transfer.py module to transfer a small file to the Cisco pynet-rtr1 router.
